Emergency face shield with minimal resources

Emergency Face Shield Mask – COVID19

REGGS® (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) developed in collaboration with Anega Energies Manufacturient PLC (Addis Abeba, Ethiopia) an emergency face shield mask. The mask can be produced out of minimal resources, like any transparent rigid plasic foil and a shoelace. 

This face shield is developed as emergency alternative for places where there is a low supply or access to personal protective equipment (PPE). It is quick to produce through with minimal components through simple production processes, such as laser cutting or manual cutting. 

Important to note that people who assembly and fabricate the mask should be healthy and wear proper protective equipment such as gloves and respirator mask. This mask is not a replacement for respirator masks (FFP2, FFP3). 

During the development of this mask many other great projects have been published. Please have a look at these projects to determine which best suits your needs with the resources at hand:


We also want to give a special thanks to any opensource project for sharing their efforts publicly.
